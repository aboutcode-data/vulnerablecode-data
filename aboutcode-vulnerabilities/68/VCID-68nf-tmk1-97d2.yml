summary: "Contrast workload secrets leak to logs on INFO level\n### Impact\n\nWhen the Contrast\
  \ initializer is configured with a `CONTRAST_LOG_LEVEL` of `info` or `debug`, the workload\
  \ secret is logged to `stderr` and written to Kubernetes logs. \n\nSince `info` is the default\
  \ setting, this affects all Contrast installations that don't customize their initializers'\
  \ log level.\n\nThe following audiences are **intended** to have access to workload secrets\
  \ (see https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/1.7/architecture/secrets#workload-secrets):\n\
  \n* Contrast Coordinator (can derive all workload secrets)\n* Contrast Initializer (obtains\
  \ only the secret configured in the manifest)\n* Seedshare owner (can derive all workload\
  \ secrets)\n* Workload owner (can update manifests to obtain secrets)\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ allows the following parties **unintended access** to workload secrets issued by a Coordinator:\n\
  \n* Kubernetes users with `get` or `list` permission on `pods/logs`.\n* Others with read access\
  \ to the Kubernetes log storage (most notably, the cloud provider).\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ **does not affect** scenarios where workload secrets are not used by the application (directly\
  \ or with [secure persistence](https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/1.7/architecture/secrets#secure-persistence)).\
  \ Applications designed for workload owner exclusion can't use workload secrets and are thus\
  \ unaffected.\n\n### Patches\n\nN/A\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated\
  \ by adding an environment variable `CONTRAST_LOG_LEVEL=warn` to the initializer after running\
  \ `contrast generate`, and then running `contrast generate` again.\n\n### References\n\nN/A"
