summary: |
  Potential inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol compromise via "Dragonberry" vulnerability in cheqd
  ### Impact
  This vulnerability affects IBC transfers due to a security vulnerability dubbed "Dragonberry" upstream in [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9). The vulnerability could allow malicious attackers to compromise chain-to-chain IBC transfers.

  There is no vulnerability in the DID/resource modules for cheqd-node.

  ### Patches
  Node operators are requested to upgrade to [cheqd-node v0.6.9](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/0.6.9) as soon as possible. Installation instructions are in the release notes. Please do not install any beta/pre-release versions.

  ### Workarounds
  No. The patch takes effect when more than 2/3rds of the voting power of the cheqd network has upgraded to this patch.

  An emergency hotfix was released previously under v0.6.8 but this is now deprecated since [Cosmos SDK v0.45.9](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9) officially fixes this upstream.
