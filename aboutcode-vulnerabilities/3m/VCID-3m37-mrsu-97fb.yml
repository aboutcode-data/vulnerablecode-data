summary: "Shopware vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – order invoice\n### Impact\n\
  This vulnerability allows malicious actors to force the application server to send HTTP requests\
  \ to both external and internal servers. In certain cases, this may lead to access to internal\
  \ resources such as databases, file systems, or other services that are not supposed to be\
  \ directly accessible from the internet.\n\nThe overall impact of this vulnerability is considered\
  \ limited, as the functionality is highly restricted and only processes IMG tags.\n\n####\
  \ Description\nServer-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that enables a malicious\
  \ actor to manipulate an application server into performing HTTP requests to arbitrary domains.\
  \ SSRF is commonly exploited to make the server initiate requests to its internal systems\
  \ or other services within the same network, which are typically not exposed to external users.\
  \ In some cases, SSRF can also be used to target external systems. A successful SSRF attack\
  \ can result in unauthorized actions or access to data within the\norganization, the web application\
  \ itself, or other backend systems the application communicates with. In worst-case scenario,\
  \ a SSRF vulnerability can be exploited to execute malicious code on the server.\n\n#### Applicability\
  \ \nThe PDF generator used to create order invoices contains a Server-Side Request Forgery\
  \ (SSRF)\nvulnerability.\nAdministrative users can generate invoices for completed orders\
  \ and have the option to add a note to the invoice. This input is currently not adequately\
  \ filtered for (malicious) HTML characters. When a malicious actor submits an IMG tag as input,\
  \ the PDF generator attempts to retrieve an external image while processing the IMG tag. As\
  \ a result, the application server can be used to perform an HTTP request, enabling the malicious\
  \ actors to reach both external and internal servers.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an admin\
  \ account is required.\n\n#### Reproduction\nTo reproduce this vulnerability, the steps below\
  \ can be followed.\n1. Log in as an admin and navigate to the following URL:\nhttps://<your-site>.shopware.store/admin#/sw/order/detail/0198e0afa2cb70ceb76ad64fc7864ca6/documents?limit=25&page=1&term=&sortBy&sortDirection=ASC&naturalSorting=false\n\
  2. Click the button ‘Create document’ and create a ‘Partial cancellation’ document.\n3. As\
  \ a comment add the following code:\n```\n<img src=\"<malicious image link>\" width=\"250\"\
  \ height=\"100\"/>\n```\n4. Press the preview button to view the PFD.\n5. Observe that the\
  \ image is shown in the PDF."
