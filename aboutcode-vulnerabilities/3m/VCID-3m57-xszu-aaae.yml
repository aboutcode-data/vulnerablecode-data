summary: |
  Remote code execution and potential Denial of Service Vulnerability
  Activeresource contains a format string flaw in the request function of `lib/active_resource/connection.rb`. The issue is triggered as format string specifiers (e.g. `%s` and `%x`) are not properly sanitized in user-supplied input when passed via the `result.code` and `result.message` variables. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.
