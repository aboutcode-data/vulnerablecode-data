  Duplicate Advisory: NATS.io: Adding accounts for just the system account adds auth bypass
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-fr2g-9hjm-wr23. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  NATS nats-server before 2.9.23 and 2.10.x before 2.10.2 has an authentication bypass. An implicit $G user in an authorization block can sometimes be used for unauthenticated access, even when the intention of the configuration was for each user to have an account. The earliest affected version is 2.2.0.
