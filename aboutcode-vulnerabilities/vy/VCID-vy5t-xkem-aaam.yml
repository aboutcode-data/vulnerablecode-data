summary: |
  Private tokens could appear in logs if context containing gRPC metadata is logged in github.com/grpc/grpc-go
  ### Impact
  This issue represents a potential PII concern.  If applications were printing or logging a context containing gRPC metadata, the affected versions will contain all the metadata, which may include private information.

  ### Patches
  The issue first appeared in 1.64.0 and is patched in 1.64.1 and 1.65.0

  ### Workarounds
  If using an affected version and upgrading is not possible, ensuring you do not log or print contexts will avoid the problem.
