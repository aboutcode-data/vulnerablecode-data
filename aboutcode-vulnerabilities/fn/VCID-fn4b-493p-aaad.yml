summary: The `featurebook` is vulnerable to a Directory Traversal attack. This may allow attackers
  to access confidential resources that exist outside of the intended web root of the service.
  This is mitigated significantly by the fact that `featurebook` is clearly not intended to
  be run in production code nor to be exposed to an untrusted network.
