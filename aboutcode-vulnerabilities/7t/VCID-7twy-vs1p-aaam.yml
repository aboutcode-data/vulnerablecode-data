summary: "Prototype Pollution in unflatten\nAll versions of `unflatten` are vulnerable to prototype\
  \ pollution. The function `unflatten` does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype,\
  \ which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all\
  \ objects. \n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until\
  \ a fix is made available."
