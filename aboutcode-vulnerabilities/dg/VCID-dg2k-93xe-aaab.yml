summary: |
  File upload exposure
  The userforms module allows CMS administrators to create public facing forms with file upload abilities. These files are uploaded into a predictable public path on the website, unless configured otherwise by the CMS administrator setting up the form. While the name of the uploaded file itself is not predictable, certain actions taken by CMS authors could expose it. For example, submission notification emails contain a link to the file without authorisation checks.
