summary: "Apollo Router Improperly Enforces Renamed Access Control Directives\n# Summary \n\
  A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed for unauthorized access to protected data through\
  \ schema elements with access control directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and\
  \ `@policy`) that were renamed via `@link` imports. Router did not enforce renamed access\
  \ control directives on schema elements (e.g. fields and types), allowing queries to bypass\
  \ those element-level access controls.\n\n## Details\n\nApollo Federation allows users to\
  \ specify access control directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authorization-directives))\
  \ to protect schema data access at the element level. These directives can optionally be renamed\
  \ via the [`imports` argument to the `@link` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/reference/directives#renaming-directives),\
  \ which can be useful if their default names match an existing user-defined directive in their\
  \ subgraph schema. However, Apollo Router's access control logic ignored the `imports` argument,\
  \ and would accordingly ignore access control directives that were renamed in this way.\n\n\
  ## Who Is Impacted\n\nThis vulnerability impacts Apollo Router customers defining `@authenticated`,\
  \ `@requiresScopes`, or `@policy` directives on schema elements that were renamed via `@link`\
  \ imports are impacted.\n\n### Scope of Impact\n\nThe vulnerability could allow a malicious\
  \ actor to craft a query that can bypass access control requirements on schema elements protected\
  \ by renamed access control directives.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed\
  \ in Apollo Router by updating the access control logic to handle the `imports` argument in\
  \ `@link` directives. You will need to update Router to one of the following versions:\n\n\
  - 1.61.12+\n- 2.8.1+\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- If you are not immediately updating Router to\
  \ a patched version, you should remove any renames of access control directives in the `imports`\
  \ argument to the `@link` directive.\n- Customers not using Apollo Router with renamed access\
  \ control directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`) are not affected\
  \ and do not need to take action."
