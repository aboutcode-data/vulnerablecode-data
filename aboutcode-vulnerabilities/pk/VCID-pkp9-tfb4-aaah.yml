  Bypass CSP protection
  Extension URIs (`resource://...`) bypass ````Content-Security-Policy```` in Chrome and Firefox and can always be loaded. Now if a site already has a XSS bug, and uses CSP to protect itself, but the user has an extension installed that uses Angular, an attacked can load Angular from the extension, and Angular's auto-bootstrapping can be used to bypass the victim site's CSP protection.
