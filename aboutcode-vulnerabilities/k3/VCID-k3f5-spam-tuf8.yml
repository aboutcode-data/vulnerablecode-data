  - GHSA-4xc4-762w-m6cg
summary: |
  pypdf has possible long runtimes for missing /Root object with large /Size values
  ### Impact
  An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to possibly long runtimes for actually invalid files. This can be achieved by omitting the `/Root` entry in the trailer, while using a rather large `/Size` value. Only the non-strict reading mode is affected.

  ### Patches
  This has been fixed in [pypdf==6.6.0](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.6.0).

  ### Workarounds

  ```python
  from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter


  # Instead of
  reader = PdfReader("file.pdf")
  # use the strict mode:
  reader = PdfReader("file.pdf", strict=True)

  # Instead of
  writer = PdfWriter(clone_from="file.pdf")
  # use an explicit strict reader:
  writer = PdfWriter(clone_from=PdfReader("file.pdf", strict=True))
  ```
