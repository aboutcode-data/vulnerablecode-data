summary: "RISC Zero zkVM notes on zero-knowledge\nRISC Zero zkVM was designed from its inception\
  \ to provide three main guarantees:\n1. *Computational integrity*: that a given software program\
  \ executed correctly.\n2. *Succinctness*: that the proof of execution does not grow in relation\
  \ to the program being executed.\n3. *Zero Knowledge*: that details of the program execution\
  \ are not visible within the proof of program execution.\n\nUlrich Habock and Al Kindi have\
  \ released [new research] that indicates that several STARK implementations -including our\
  \ RISC Zero zkVM- do not meet the requirements to assert the specific property of zero knowledge\
  \ provably. \n\nWhile a vast majority of real-world applications that leverage RISC Zero zkVM\
  \ or similar systems depend primarily on computational integrity and succinctness, a subset\
  \ of applications critically depend on the privacy guarantees provided by zero-knowledge;\
  \ and for those use cases, users are cautioned to understand the research and make informed\
  \ decisions based on the risks outlined in using an impacted system.\n\nAlthough the maintainers\
  \ are not aware of any attacks that can take advantage of this potential weakness, they are\
  \ working to proactively address this discovery as quickly as possible. \n\n[new research]:\
