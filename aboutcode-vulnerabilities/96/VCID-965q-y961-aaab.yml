summary: |
  goreleaser shows environment by default
  ### Summary
  Since #4787 the log output is printed on the INFO level, while previously it was logged on DEBUG. This means if the `go build` output is non-empty, goreleaser leaks the environment.

  ### PoC
  * Create a Go project with dependencies, do not pull them yet (or run goreleaser later in a container, or delete `$GOPATH/pkg`).
  * Make sure to have secrets set in the environment
  * Make sure to not have `go mod tidy` in a before hook
  * Run `goreleaser release --clean`
  * Go prints lots of `go: downloading ...` lines, which triggers the "if output not empty, log it" line, which includes the environment.

  ### Impact
  Credentials and tokens are leaked.
