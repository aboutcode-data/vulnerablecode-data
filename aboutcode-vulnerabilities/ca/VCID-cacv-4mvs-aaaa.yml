  nftables binding to an already bound chain
  ### Impact
  An issue was discovered in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel. A denial of service can occur upon binding to an already bound chain.

  Affected by this vulnerability is the function nft_verdict_init of the file net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a denial of service vulnerability. The program does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

  ### Patches
  The fix has been backported to [5.15.64](https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves/CVE-2022-39190) version of the upstream Linux kernel (5.15 is the upstream Kernel long term version Talos ships with). Talos >= v1.2.0 is shipped with Linux Kernel 5.15.64 fixing the above issue.

  ### Workarounds
  It's recommended to upgrade
