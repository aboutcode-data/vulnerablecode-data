summary: |
  Forgeable Public/Private Tokens
  Since `algorithm` isn't enforced in `jwt.decode()`, a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker wants.
