  Nervos CKB P2P DoS Attacks
  The P2P protocols lack of rate limit. For example, in relay protocol, when a node receives a broadcasted `tx_hashes`, it will mark it in memory to avoid duplicated requests. [code → ](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/26e4837212c392c3c706a0da7a056131fb060433/sync/src/relayer/transactions_process.rs#L67).

  It is easy to establish a DoS attach by generating random tx hashes.

  ### Impact

  It affects all nodes connected to the P2P network.

  ### Workarounds

  Apply rate limit on the data sent to CKB P2P port.
