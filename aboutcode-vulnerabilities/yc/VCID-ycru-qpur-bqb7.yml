  - CVE-2025-68352
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: ch341: fix
  out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one  Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability
  Discovery Engine.  The ''len'' variable is calculated as ''min(32, trans->len + 1)'', which
  includes the 1-byte command header.  When copying data from ''trans->tx_buf'' to ''ch341->tx_buf
  + 1'', using ''len'' as the length is incorrect because:  1. It causes an out-of-bounds read
  from ''trans->tx_buf'' (which has size    ''trans->len'', i.e., ''len - 1'' in this context).
  2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to ''ch341->tx_buf'' if ''len'' is    CH341_PACKET_LENGTH
  (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341->tx_buf + 1    overflows the buffer.  Fix this by copying
  ''len - 1'' bytes.'
