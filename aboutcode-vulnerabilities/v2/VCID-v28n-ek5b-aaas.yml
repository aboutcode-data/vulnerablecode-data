  Directory traversal vulnerability
  When relying on the root option to restrict file access it may be possible for an application consumer to escape out of the restricted directory and access files in a similarly named directory. For example, `static(_dirname + '/public')` would allow access to `_dirname + '/public-restricted'`.
