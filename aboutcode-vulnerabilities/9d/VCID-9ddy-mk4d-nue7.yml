  - CVE-2022-50849
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pstore: Avoid
  kcore oops by vmap()ing with VM_IOREMAP  An oops can be induced by running ''cat /proc/kcore
  > /dev/null'' on devices using pstore with the ram backend because kmap_atomic() assumes lowmem
  pages are accessible with __va().   Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address

  early boot, memblock reserves the pages for the ramoops reserved memory node in DT that would
  otherwise be part of the direct lowmem mapping. Pstore''s ram backend reuses those reserved
  pages to change the memory type (writeback or non-cached) by passing the pages to vmap() (see
  pfn_to_page() usage in persistent_ram_vmap() for more details) with specific flags. When read_kcore()
  starts iterating over the vmalloc region, it runs over the virtual address that vmap() returned
  for ramoops. In aligned_vread() the virtual address is passed to vmalloc_to_page() which returns
  the page struct for the reserved lowmem area. That lowmem page is passed to kmap_atomic(),
  which effectively calls page_to_virt() that assumes a lowmem page struct must be directly
  accessible with __va() and friends. These pages are mapped via vmap() though, and the lowmem
  mapping was never made, so accessing them via the lowmem virtual address oopses like above.  Let''s
  side-step this problem by passing VM_IOREMAP to vmap(). This will tell vread() to not include
  the ramoops region in the kcore. Instead the area will look like a bunch of zeros. The alternative
  is to teach kmap() about vmalloc areas that intersect with lowmem. Presumably such a change
  isn''t a one-liner, and there isn''t much interest in inspecting the ramoops region in kcore
  files anyway, so the most expedient route is taken for now.'
