summary: "SurrealDB is Vulnerable to Unauthorized Data Exposure via LIVE Query Subscriptions\n\
  `LIVE SELECT` statements are used to capture changes to data within a table in real time.\
  \ Documents included in `WHERE` conditions and `DELETE` notifications were not properly reduced\
  \ to respect the querying user's security context. Instead the leaked documents reflect the\
  \ context of the user triggering the notification.\n\nThis allows a record or guest user with\
  \ permissions to run live query subscriptions on a table to observe unauthorised records within\
  \ the same table, when another user is altering or deleting these records, bypassing access\
  \ controls.\n\n### Impact\nA record or guest user with permissions to run live query subscriptions\
  \ on a table is able to observe unauthorised records within the same table, with unauthorised\
  \ records returned when deleted, or when records matching the WHERE conditions are created,\
  \ updated, or deleted, by another user. This impacts confidentiality, limited to the table\
  \ the attacker has access to, and with the data disclosed dependent of the actions taken by\
  \ other users.\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been created for the following versions:\n\n- Versions\
  \ 2.1.9, 2.2.8 and 2.3.8 and later are not affected by this issue. \n- The first release following\
  \ v3.0.0-alpha.7 will be patched.\n\n### Workarounds\nAssess the impact of users with permissions\
  \ on table records effectively having full read access to the table, use separate tables if\
  \ required, with impacts to functionality."
