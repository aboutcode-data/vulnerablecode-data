summary: |
  `temporary` makes use of uninitialized memory
  Uninitialized memory is used as a RNG seed in temporary. This has been resolved in the 0.6.4 release. The crate is not intended to be used outside of a testing environment. For a general purpose crate to create temporary directories, [`tempfile`](https://crates.io/crates/tempfile) is an alternative for this crate.
