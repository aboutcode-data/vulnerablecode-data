summary: "Craft CMS vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via GraphQL Asset Upload\
  \ Mutation\nThe Craft CMS GraphQL `save_<VolumeName>_Asset` mutation is vulnerable to Server-Side\
  \ Request Forgery (SSRF). This vulnerability arises because the `_file` input, specifically\
  \ its `url` parameter, allows the server to fetch content from arbitrary remote locations\
  \ without proper validation. Attackers can exploit this by providing internal IP addresses\
  \ or cloud metadata endpoints as the `url`, forcing the server to make requests to these restricted\
  \ services. The fetched content is then saved as an asset, which can subsequently be accessed\
  \ and exfiltrated, leading to potential data exposure and infrastructure compromise. This\
  \ exploitation requires specific GraphQL permissions for asset management within the targeted\
  \ volume.\n\nUsers should update to the patched 5.8.21 and 4.16.17 releases to mitigate the\
  \ issue.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/013db636fdb38f3ce5657fd196b6d952f98ebc52\n\
  \nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.x/CHANGELOG.md#5821---2025-12-04\n\n---\n\n### Required\
  \ Permissions\n\nThe exploitation requires a few permissions to be enabled in the used GraphQL\
  \ schema:\n- \"Edit assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume\"\n- \"Create assets in the `<VolumeName>`\
  \ volume\"\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Log in to the Craft CMS control panel as an admin.\n\
  \n2. Create a new volume if you haven’t yet.\n\n3. Create a new schema (or use the full/public\
  \ schema) and enable the permissions mentioned above in the **Required Permissions** section.\n\
  \n4. Go to **GraphiQL**: `http://craft.local/admin/graphiql` & set the created schema.\n\n\
  5. Run the following GraphQL mutation to upload an Asset *(Replace the `<VolumeName>` with\
  \ your volume name)*:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n    save_<VolumeName>_Asset(_file: { \n \
  \       url: \"http://127.0.0.1:80/index.php\"\n        filename: \"poc.txt\"\n    }) {\n\
  \        id\n    }\n}\n```\n\n6. Note that the `index.php` response will be saved as `poc.txt`\
  \ & its content will be accessible via the asset preview/download functionality.\n\n8. For\
  \ the PoC, `http://127.0.0.1:80/index.php` was used as an example. However, the `url` parameter\
  \ can be leveraged to target internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, or any arbitrary\
  \ external URL.\n\n## Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this SSRF vulnerability allows\
  \ attackers to access internal network resources, bypass firewall rules, and conduct network\
  \ reconnaissance.\n\nIn cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure), this can lead to the theft of\
  \ sensitive credentials (e.g., IAM roles, service account tokens) from metadata endpoints,\
  \ potentially resulting in the full compromise of the underlying infrastructure and the exfiltration\
  \ of sensitive data.\n\n---\n\nUsers should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17)\
  \ to mitigate the issue.\n\nUsers running Craft 3.5.0+ should update to the latest Craft 4.16.17\
  \ or 5.8.21 releases."
