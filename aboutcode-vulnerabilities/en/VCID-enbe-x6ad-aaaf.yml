  Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information in moment-timezone
  ### Impact

  * if Alice uses `grunt data` (or `grunt release`) to prepare a custom-build, moment-timezone with the latest tzdata from IANA's website
  * and Mallory intercepts the request to IANA's unencrypted ftp server, Mallory can serve data which might exploit further stages of the moment-timezone tzdata pipeline, or potentially produce a tainted version of moment-timezone (practicality of such attacks is not proved)

  ### Patches
  Problem has been patched in version 0.5.35, patch should be applicable with minor modifications to all affected versions. The patch includes changing the FTP endpoint with an HTTPS endpoint.

  ### Workarounds
  Specify the exact version of tzdata (like `2014d`, full command being `grunt data:2014d`, then run the rest of the release tasks by hand), or just apply the patch before issuing the grunt command.
