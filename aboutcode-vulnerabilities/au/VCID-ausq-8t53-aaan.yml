  - GHSA-26hr-q2wp-rvc5
summary: |
  User with permission to write actions can impersonate another user when auth token is configured in environment variable
  ### Impact

  When lakeFS is configured with **ALL** of the following:

  - Configuration option `auth.encrypt.secret_key` passed through environment variable
  - Actions enabled via configuration option `actions.enabled` (default enabled)

  then a user who can configure an action can impersonate any other user.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  ### Workarounds

  **ANY ONE** of these is sufficient to prevent the issue:

  * Do not pass `auth.encrypt.secret_key` through an environment variable.

     For instance, Kubernetes users can generate the entire configuration as a secret and mount that.  This is described [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-a-secret).
  * Disable actions.
  * Limit users allowed to configure actions.
