summary: |
  Queued jobs serialised data exposure
  SavedJobData and SavedJobMessages contain php serialized data. There's no point showing these to a CMS Admin as they're not human readable. Worse, it might be insecure, as a malicious CMS Admin might be able to craft a payload thats dangerous to unserialize. This issue has been resolved by hiding this content, even from administrators.
