summary: "Spinnaker vulnerable to SSRF due to improper restrictions on http from user input\n\
  ### Impact\nThe primary impact is allowing users to fetch data from a remote URL.  This data\
  \ can be then injected into Spinnaker pipelines via helm or other methods to extract things\
  \ LIKE idmsv1 authentication data.  This ALSO includes calling INTERNAL Spinnaker API's via\
  \ a get and similar endpoints.  Further, depending upon the artifact configuration, auth data\
  \ may be exposed to arbitrary endpoints (e.g. GitHub auth headers) leading to credentials\
  \ exposure.   \n\nTo trigger this, a Spinnaker installation MUST have:\n* An artifact enabled\
  \ that allows user input.  This includes GitHub file artifacts, BitBucket, GitLab, HTTP artifacts\
  \ and similar artifact providers.  JUST enabling the http artifact provider will add a \"\
  no-auth\" http provider that could be used to extract link local data (e.g. AWS Metadata information).\n\
  * A system that can consume the output of these artifacts.  E.g. Rosco helm can use this to\
  \ fetch values data.  K8s account manifests if the API returns JSON can be used to inject\
  \ that data into the pipeline itself though the pipeline would fail.\n\nTo note, due to the\
  \ way the URLs are viable to be injected, CERTAIN systems can be used to provide DOS attacks\
  \ on Spinnaker itself.  These would NOT compromise the system per se, given restarts and timeout\
  \ configuration, but could lead to internal attacks by a Spinnaker user against Spinnaker\
  \ services.  An example is that an artifact fetch reference could return an infinite response\
  \ data feed or similar that can act as a DOS attack.  It's recommended to set strong limits\
  \ on the various http limits AND artifact URLs to known valid URLs. \n\n### Patches\nFixed\
  \ in clouddriver versiosn 2025.2.3, 2025.1.5, 2025.0.9.  Impacts all prior Spinnaker releases.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nDisable HTTP account types that allow user input of a given URL.  This\
  \ is probably not feasible in MOST cases.  Git, Docker and other artifact account types with\
  \ explicit URL configurations bypass this limitation and should be safe as they limit artifact\
  \ URL loading.\n\nAlternatively using one of the various vendors which provide OPA policies\
  \ to restrict pipelines from accessing or saving a pipeline with invalid URLs."
