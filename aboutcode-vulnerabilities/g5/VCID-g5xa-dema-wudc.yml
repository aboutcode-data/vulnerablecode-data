  - CVE-2023-54026
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  opp: Fix use-after-free
  in lazy_opp_tables after probe deferral  When dev_pm_opp_of_find_icc_paths() in _allocate_opp_table()
  returns -EPROBE_DEFER, the opp_table is freed again, to wait until all the interconnect paths
  are available.  However, if the OPP table is using required-opps then it may already have
  been added to the global lazy_opp_tables list. The error path does not remove the opp_table
  from the list again.  This can cause crashes later when the provider of the required-opps
  is added, since we will iterate over OPP tables that have already been freed. E.g.:    Unable
  to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference when read   CPU: 0 PID: 7 Comm: kworker/0:0 Not
  tainted 6.4.0-rc3   PC is at _of_add_opp_table_v2 (include/linux/of.h:949   drivers/opp/of.c:98
  drivers/opp/of.c:344 drivers/opp/of.c:404   drivers/opp/of.c:1032) -> lazy_link_required_opp_table()  Fix
  this by calling _of_clear_opp_table() to remove the opp_table from the list and clear other
  allocated resources. While at it, also add the missing mutex_destroy() calls in the error
  path.'
