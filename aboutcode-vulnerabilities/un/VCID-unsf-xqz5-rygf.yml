summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  landlock: Fix
  handling of disconnected directories  Disconnected files or directories can appear when they
  are visible and opened from a bind mount, but have been renamed or moved from the source of
  the bind mount in a way that makes them inaccessible from the mount point (i.e. out of scope).  Previously,
  access rights tied to files or directories opened through a disconnected directory were collected
  by walking the related hierarchy down to the root of the filesystem, without taking into account
  the mount point because it couldn''t be found. This could lead to inconsistent access results,
  potential access right widening, and hard-to-debug renames, especially since such paths cannot
  be printed.  For a sandboxed task to create a disconnected directory, it needs to have write
  access (i.e. FS_MAKE_REG, FS_REMOVE_FILE, and FS_REFER) to the underlying source of the bind
  mount, and read access to the related mount point.   Because a sandboxed task cannot acquire
  more access rights than those defined by its Landlock domain, this could lead to inconsistent
  access rights due to missing permissions that should be inherited from the mount point hierarchy,
  while inheriting permissions from the filesystem hierarchy hidden by this mount point instead.  Landlock
  now handles files and directories opened from disconnected directories by taking into account
  the filesystem hierarchy when the mount point is not found in the hierarchy walk, and also
  always taking into account the mount point from which these disconnected directories were
  opened.  This ensures that a rename is not allowed if it would widen access rights [1].  The
  rationale is that, even if disconnected hierarchies might not be visible or accessible to
  a sandboxed task, relying on the collected access rights from them improves the guarantee
  that access rights will not be widened during a rename because of the access right comparison
  between the source and the destination (see LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER). It may look like this
  would grant more access on disconnected files and directories, but the security policies are
  always enforced for all the evaluated hierarchies.  This new behavior should be less surprising
  to users and safer from an access control perspective.  Remove a wrong WARN_ON_ONCE() canary
  in collect_domain_accesses() and fix the related comment.  Because opened files have their
  access rights stored in the related file security properties, there is no impact for disconnected
  or unlinked files.'
