summary: "Etcd Gateway TLS endpoint validation only confirms TCP reachability\n### Vulnerability\
  \ type\nCryptography\n\n### Workarounds\nRefer to the [gateway documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md).\
  \ The vulnerability was spotted due to unclear documentation of how the gateway handles endpoints\
  \ validation. \n\n### Detail\nSecure endpoint validation is performed by the etcd gateway\
  \ start command when the --discovery-srv flag is enabled. However, as currently implemented,\
  \ it only validates TCP reachability, effectively allowing connections to an endpoint that\
  \ doesn't accept TLS connections through the HTTPS URL. The auditors has noted that appropriate\
  \ documentation of this validation functionality plus deprecation of this misleading functionality\
  \ is an acceptable path forward.\n\n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in\
  \ the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\
  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*\
  \ Contact the [etcd security committee](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md#product-security-committee-psc)"
