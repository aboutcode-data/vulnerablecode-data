summary: |
  Directory Traversal
  A crafted GET request can be leveraged to traverse the directory structure of a host using the `augustine` web server package, and request arbitrary files outside of the specified web root. This allows for a remote attacker to gain access to arbitrary files on the filesystem that the process has access to read. Mitigating factors: Only files that the user running `augustine` has permission to read will be accessible via this vulnerability.
