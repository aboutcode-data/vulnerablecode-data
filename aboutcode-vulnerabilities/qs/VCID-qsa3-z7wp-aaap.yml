summary: "Validation of `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` can cause chain halt in Go package github.com/cometbft/cometbft\n\
  ## Summary\n\nA vulnerability in CometBFT’s validation logic for `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight`\
  \ can result in a chain halt when triggered through a governance parameter change proposal\
  \ on an ABCI2 Application Chain. If a parameter change proposal including a `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight`\
  \ modification is passed, nodes running the affected versions may panic, halting the network.\n\
  \nThe CometBFT team addressed this issue by improving validation logic for the `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight`\
  \ to correctly handle governance proposals addressing this parameter.\n\n## Next Steps for\
  \ Impacted Parties\n\nIf you are a chain developer with an active network running on CometBFT\
  \ v. 0.38.x, we recommend updating your chain application to v0.38.3 or later of CometBFT\
  \ to patch this issue. \n\nThis issue can be resolved with a “soft patch” to an active network,\
  \ i.e. nodes can be patched and restarted at different times without the need for a coordinated\
  \ upgrade that halts a chain. If this patching methodology is used, the risk of a network\
  \ halt triggered by this issue is mitigated once more than 66.7% of voting power on the network\
  \ has applied the update, which provides protection from exploitation while on-chain governance\
  \ processes for software upgrades take place. Once all validator nodes operating a network\
  \ have been updated, the risk of a network halt due to this issue will be fully resolved.\
  \ \n\nFor more information about CometBFT, see https://docs.cometbft.com/. \n\nThis issue\
  \ was found by Dongsam ([@b_harvest](https://twitter.com/b__harvest?lang=en)) who reported\
  \ it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 15, 2024. If you believe you\
  \ have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting\
  \ a bug, please see https://hackerone.com/cosmos."
