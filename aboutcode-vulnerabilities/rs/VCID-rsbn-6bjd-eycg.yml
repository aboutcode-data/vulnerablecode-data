aliases:
  - CVE-2023-54172
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/hyperv: Disable
  IBT when hypercall page lacks ENDBR instruction  On hardware that supports Indirect Branch
  Tracking (IBT), Hyper-V VMs with ConfigVersion 9.3 or later support IBT in the guest. However,
  current versions of Hyper-V have a bug in that there''s not an ENDBR64 instruction at the
  beginning of the hypercall page. Since hypercalls are made with an indirect call to the hypercall
  page, all hypercall attempts fail with an exception and Linux panics.  A Hyper-V fix is in
  progress to add ENDBR64. But guard against the Linux panic by clearing X86_FEATURE_IBT if
  the hypercall page doesn''t start with ENDBR. The VM will boot and run without IBT.  If future
  Linux 32-bit kernels were to support IBT, additional hypercall page hackery would be needed
  to make IBT work for such kernels in a Hyper-V VM.'
