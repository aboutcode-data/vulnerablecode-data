summary: "Directus allows unauthenticated file upload and file modification due to lacking input\
  \ sanitization\n## Summary\n\nA vulnerability exists in the file update mechanism which allows\
  \ an unauthenticated actor to modify existing files with arbitrary contents (without changes\
  \ being applied to the files' database-resident metadata) and / or upload new files, with\
  \ arbitrary content and extensions, which won't show up in the Directus UI.\n\n## Details\n\
  \nDirectus exposes the CRUD operations for uploading or handling files under the `/files`\
  \ route.\n\nThe endpoint handler is responsible for updating an existing file identified by\
  \ the provided primary key specified through the `pk` parameter. Primary keys are UUID values\
  \ such as `/files/927b3abf-fb4b-4c66-bdaa-eb7dc48a51cb`. Here the `filename_disk` value is\
  \ never sanitized, it's possible to pass a path containing traversal sequences (`../`) through\
  \ it, but a fully arbitrary file write is not possible in case the \"local\" storage handler\
  \ is used. (Other storage implementations haven't been checked during the research process).\
  \ The `packages/storage-driver-local/src/index.ts` file defines two relevant functions: `write`\
  \ and `fullpath`.\n\nThe `write` method uses the `fullPath` method to create the absolute\
  \ path for the to-be-created file. The `join` method is used to create the final path string.\
  \ As the `fullPath` method uses `join` to create a relative path starting with the separator\
  \ to be added under the download dir, this call normalizes the path and further upwards traversal\
  \ is not possible during the write operation. With that being said, it is still possible,\
  \ to make the system \"ignore\" the `temp_` prefix given to the file, resulting in an arbitrarily\
  \ named file being placed in the upload folder.\n\nAs a summary for the vulnerability:\n\n\
  - It is possible, to change the contents of an existing file, as an existing UUID can be specified\
  \ as the file name\n        - The metadata won't change, so the mime type cannot be modified\n\
  \        - This also makes the changes happen \"silently\", without directus knowing about\
  \ the changes\n- A new, previously non-existent file can be created with arbitrary contents\n\
  \        - The file won't show up in on the Directus UI, it can only be seen through other\
  \ means (such as shell access)\n- An extension MUST be defined for the file to be modified\n\
  \        - This prevents us from uploading executables or malware with no extensions, but\
  \ these wouldn't be executable either way\n\nRecommendations for fixing the vulnerability\
  \ can be found in later chapters.\n\n## Requirements \n\nAs providing a primary key is required\
  \ for successful exploitation, at least one asset with a known UUID must be available for\
  \ an attacker. This can usually be achieved by browsing an application that uses the given\
  \ Directus instance to provide images. \n\nNaturally, the instance needs to be accessible\
  \ over the network used by the attacker as well.\n\nOnce network access and knowledge of at\
  \ least one file UUID is available for the attacker, exploitation can be done by sending a\
  \ single request.\n\n## Potential impacts\n\nThe impact of successful exploitation is highly\
  \ dependent on how Directus is set up to be used by a different application. Many different\
  \ configurations can be created, but the following are likely the most noteworthy:\n\n1. Setting\
  \ up a phishing site\n\nSVGs can be used to set up very sophisticated looking pages, as it\
  \ allows the embedding of HTML, CSS and scripts. The issue is once again with the `default-src:\
  \ none` CSP settings. This setting prevents the use of CSS in the SVG file, so the created\
  \ page will look strange.\n\nWhile the page obviously looks strange, it's important to notice\
  \ that since the domain checks out, the browser could fill out the login forms, making for\
  \ a much more convincing page as shown below:\n\nAn error message can be used to make it look\
  \ like an error in the system!\n\n2. Server serves files directly from the upload directory:\n\
  \nIn this setup, a server such ash nginx serves files in a static manner. The served files\
  \ are loaded from a \"public\" folder made accessible through Directus as it's recommended\
  \ in the files API docs. Quoting: \"make a public folder and allow access to this\", except\
  \ the upload folder is directly served by the server:\n\nSince the files loaded by the server\
  \ are sourced directly from the file storage, the arbitrary file write might allow an attacker\
  \ to upload a webshell into the folder, giving it an arbitrary file extension. As the extension\
  \ checks out as a valid PHP file for instance, and the contents are correct code, an attacker\
  \ can achieve unauthenticated code execution on the server.\n\n3. Poisoning hosted files\n\
  \nThe previous examples focused on active exploitation, but it's important to mention that\
  \ the vulnerability allows for arbitrary changes in files. This can be used for many different\
  \ attack primitives. Let's consider the following scenario: Directus is used not only to serve\
  \ contents on a company's web page, but internally as well. Onboarding documents for new entries\
  \ are hosted on the instance. Manuals with links to internal services are provided through\
  \ PDF files. If the file can be accessed and modified by an attacker, it would be trivial\
  \ to set up a spoofed instance which receives credentials for internal services but redirects\
  \ to the original, internal service right after. \n\n## Credits\n\nThe bug was discovered\
