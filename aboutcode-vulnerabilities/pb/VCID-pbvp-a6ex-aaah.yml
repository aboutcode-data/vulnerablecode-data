  - GHSA-fqfh-778m-2v32
summary: |
  GitHub CLI can execute a git binary from the current directory
  ### Impact
  GitHub CLI depends on a `git.exe` executable being found in system `%PATH%` on Windows. However, if a malicious `.\git.exe` or `.\git.bat` is found in the current working directory at the time of running `gh`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one.

  Windows users who run `gh` inside untrusted directories are affected.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to GitHub CLI v1.2.1.

  ### Workarounds
  Other than avoiding untrusted repositories, there is no workaround.
