summary: |
  Action Commands (run/shell/exec) Against Library URIs Ignore Configured Remote Endpoint
  # Impact
  Due to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint.

  An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container.

  Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint.

  # Patches
  All users should upgrade to Singularity 3.7.4 or later.

  # Workarounds
  Users who only interact with the default remote endpoint or do not use the library:// url are not affected.

  Installations with an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys are not affected.
