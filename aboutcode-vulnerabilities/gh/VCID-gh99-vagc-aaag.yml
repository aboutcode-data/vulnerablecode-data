summary: "curve25519-dalek has timing variability in `curve25519-dalek`'s `Scalar29::sub`/`Scalar52::sub`\n\
  Timing variability of any kind is problematic when working with  potentially secret values\
  \ such as\nelliptic curve scalars, and such issues can potentially leak private keys and other\
  \ secrets. Such a\nproblem was recently discovered in `curve25519-dalek`.\n\nThe `Scalar29::sub`\
  \ (32-bit) and `Scalar52::sub` (64-bit) functions contained usage of a mask value\ninside\
  \ a loop where LLVM saw an opportunity to insert a branch instruction (`jns` on x86) to\n\
  conditionally bypass this code section when the mask value is set to zero as can be seen in\
  \ godbolt:\n\n- 32-bit (see L106): https://godbolt.org/z/zvaWxzvqv\n- 64-bit (see L48): https://godbolt.org/z/PczYj7Pda\n\
  \nA similar problem was recently discovered in the Kyber reference implementation:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/hqbtIGFKIpU/m/cnE3pbueBgAJ\n\
  \nAs discussed on that thread, one portable solution, which is also used in this PR, is to\
  \ introduce a\nvolatile read as an optimization barrier, which prevents the compiler from\
  \ optimizing it away.\n\nThe fix can be validated in godbolt here:\n\n- 32-bit: https://godbolt.org/z/jc9j7eb8E\n\
  - 64-bit: https://godbolt.org/z/x8d46Yfah\n\nThe problem was discovered and the solution independently\
  \ verified by \nAlexander Wagner <alexander.wagner@aisec.fraunhofer.de> and Lea Themint <lea.thiemt@tum.de>\
  \ using\ntheir DATA tool:\n\nhttps://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/DATA"
