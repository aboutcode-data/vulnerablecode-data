summary: |
  Improper Authorization in @sap-cloud-sdk/core
  Affected versions of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core` do not properly validate JWTs. The `verifyJwt()` function does not properly validate the URL from where the public verification key for the JWT can be downloaded. Any URL was trusted which makes it possible to provide a URL belonging to a manipulated JWT. Upgrade to or later.
