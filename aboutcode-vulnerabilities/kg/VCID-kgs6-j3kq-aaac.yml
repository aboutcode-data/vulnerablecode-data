  SQL Injection
  This package contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the /lib/brbackup.rb script not properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'name' parameter. This may allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
