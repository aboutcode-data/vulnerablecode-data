summary: "xous has unsound usages of `core::slice::from_raw_parts`\nWe consider `as_slice` and\
  \ `as_slice_mut` unsound because: the pointer with any bit patterns could be cast to the slice\
  \ of arbitrary types. The pointer could be created by unsafe new and deprecated `from_parts`.\
  \ We consider that `from_parts` should be removed in latest version because it will help trigger\
  \ unsoundness in `as_slice`. With new declared as unsafe, `as_slice` should also declared\
  \ as unsafe.  \n\nThis was patched in by marking two functions as `unsafe`."
