  ZITADEL's User Grant Deactivation not Working
  ### Impact

  ZITADEL's user grants deactivation mechanism did not work correctly. Deactivated user grants were still provided in token, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources.
  Additionally, the management and auth API always returned the state as active or did not provide any information about the state.
