summary: "Duplicate Advisory: Wildfly Server Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provider has Improper\
  \ Access Control\n## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a\
  \ duplicate of GHSA-qr6x-62gq-4ccp. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\
  \n## Original Description\nA flaw was found in the Wildfly Server Role Based Access Control\
  \ (RBAC) provider. When authorization to control management operations is secured using the\
  \ Role Based Access Control provider, a user without the required privileges can suspend or\
  \ resume the server. A user with a Monitor or Auditor role is supposed to have only read access\
  \ permissions and should not be able to suspend the server. \nThe vulnerability is caused\
  \ by the Suspend and Resume handlers not performing authorization checks to validate whether\
  \ the current user has the required permissions to proceed with the action."
