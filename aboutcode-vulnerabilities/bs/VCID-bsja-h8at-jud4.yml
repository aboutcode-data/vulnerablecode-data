summary: |
  JDA (Java Discord API) downloads external URLs when updating message components
  ### Impact

  Anyone using untrusted message components may be affected. On versions >=6.0.0,<6.1.3 of JDA, the requester will attempt to download external media URLs from components if they are used in an update or send request.

  If you are used `Message#getComponents` or similar to get a list of components and then send those components with `sendMessageComponents` or other methods, you might unintentionally download media from an external URL in the resolved media of a `Thumbnail`, `FileDisplay`, or `MediaGallery`.

  ### Patches

  This bug has been fixed in 6.1.3, and we recommend updating.

  ### Workarounds

  Avoid sending components from untrusted messages or update to version 6.1.3.
