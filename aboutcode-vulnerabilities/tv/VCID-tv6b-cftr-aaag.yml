summary: "Storing Password in Local Storage\nThe `setPassword` method (http://parseplatform.org/Parse-SDK-JS/api/2.9.1/Parse.User.html#setPassword)\
  \ stores the user's password in localStorage as raw text making it vulnerable to anyone with\
  \ access to your localStorage. We believe this is the only time that password is stored at\
  \ all. In the documentation under Users > Signing Up, it clearly states, \"We never store\
  \ passwords in plaintext, nor will we ever transmit passwords back to the client in plaintext.\"\
  \n\nExample Code:\n```js\nasync () => {\n const user = Parse.User.current()\n if (user) {\n\
  \ user.setPassword('newpass')\n await user.save()\n }\n}\n```\nAfter running the above code,\
  \ the new password will be stored in localStorage as a property named \"password\".\n\nProposed\
  \ Solution:\nBefore saving anything to localStorage, Parse should strip out any properties\
  \ named \"password\" that are attempting to be stored with a Parse.User type object.\n\nConfiguration:\n\
