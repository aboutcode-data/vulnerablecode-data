summary: "lakeFS vulnerable to Arbitrary JavaScript Injection via Direct Link to HTML Files\n\
  ### Impact\nThe browser renders the resulting HTML when opening a direct link to an HTML file\
  \ via lakeFS. Any JavaScript within that page is executed within the context of the domain\
  \ lakeFS is running in.  \nAn attacker can inject a malicious script inline, download resources\
  \ from another domain, or make arbitrary HTTP requests. This would allow the attacker to send\
  \ information to a random domain or carry out lakeFS operations while impersonating the victim.\
  \  \n\nNote that to carry out this attack, an attacker must already have access to upload\
  \ the malicious HTML file to one or more repositories. It also depends on the victim receiving\
  \ and opening the link to the malicious HTML file.\n\n### Patches\nThis is fixed in lakeFS\
  \ version 0.106.0\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds at this time."
