  - CVE-2022-50826
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipu3-imgu: Fix
  NULL pointer dereference in imgu_subdev_set_selection()  Calling v4l2_subdev_get_try_crop()
  and v4l2_subdev_get_try_compose() with a subdev state of NULL leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
  This can currently happen in imgu_subdev_set_selection() when the state passed in is NULL,
  as this method first gets pointers to both the "try" and "active" states and only then decides
  which to use.  The same issue has been addressed for imgu_subdev_get_selection() with commit
  30d03a0de650 ("ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in active selection access"). However
  the issue still persists in imgu_subdev_set_selection().  Therefore, apply a similar fix as
  done in the aforementioned commit to imgu_subdev_set_selection(). To keep things a bit cleaner,
  introduce helper functions for "crop" and "compose" access and use them in both imgu_subdev_set_selection()
  and imgu_subdev_get_selection().'
