summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  m68k: Only force
  030 bus error if PC not in exception table  __get_kernel_nofault() does copy data in supervisor
  mode when forcing a task backtrace log through /proc/sysrq_trigger. This is expected cause
  a bus error exception on e.g. NULL pointer dereferencing when logging a kernel task has no
  workqueue associated. This bus error ought to be ignored.  Our 030 bus error handler is ill
  equipped to deal with this:  Whenever ssw indicates a kernel mode access on a data fault,
  we don''t even attempt to handle the fault and instead always send a SEGV signal (or panic).
  As a result, the check for exception handling at the fault PC (buried in send_sig_fault()
  which gets called from do_page_fault() eventually) is never used.  In contrast, both 040 and
  060 access error handlers do not care whether a fault happened on supervisor mode access,
  and will call do_page_fault() on those, ultimately honoring the exception table.  Add a check
  in bus_error030 to call do_page_fault() in case we do have an entry for the fault PC in our
  exception table.  I had attempted a fix for this earlier in 2019 that did rely on testing
  pagefault_disabled() (see link below) to achieve the same thing, but this patch should be
  more generic.  Tested on 030 Atari Falcon.'
