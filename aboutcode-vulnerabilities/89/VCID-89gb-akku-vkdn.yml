summary: |
  Preact has JSON VNode Injection issue
  ## Impact

  **Vulnerability Type:** HTML Injection via JSON Type Confusion

  **Affected Versions:** Preact 10.26.5 through 10.28.1

  **Severity:** Low to Medium (see below)

  ### Who is Impacted?

  Applications using affected Preact versions are vulnerable if they meet **all** of the following conditions:

  1. **Pass unmodified, unsanitized values** from user-modifiable data sources (APIs, databases, local storage, etc.) directly into the render tree
  2. **Assume these values are strings** but the data source could return actual JavaScript objects instead of JSON strings
  3. The data source either:
     - Fails to perform type sanitization **AND** blindly stores/returns raw objects interchangeably with strings, OR
     - Is compromised (e.g., poisoned local storage, filesystem, or database)

  ### Technical Details

  Preact includes JSON serialization protection to prevent Virtual DOM elements from being constructed from arbitrary JSON. A regression introduced in Preact 10.26.5 caused this protection to be softened. In applications where values from JSON payloads are assumed to be strings and passed unmodified to Preact as children, a specially-crafted JSON payload could be constructed that would be incorrectly treated as a valid VNode. When this chain of failures occurs it can result in HTML injection, which can allow arbitrary script execution if not mitigated by CSP or other means.

  **Important Notes:**
  - This regression was never present in `preact-render-to-string`
  - This is primarily an "expanded attack surface" issue rather than a standalone vulnerability
  - Exploitation requires either insecure API design (no type validation) or a compromised data source

  ## Patches

  **Patched Versions:**
  - **10.26.10** (for 10.26.x users)
  - **10.27.3** (for 10.27.x users)
  - **10.28.2** (for 10.28.x users)

  Users should upgrade to the latest patch version of whatever minor version they are on, which can be done via `npm update preact` or by installing one of the above versions directly.

  The patch versions simply restore the previous strict equality checks that prevent JSON-parsed objects from being treated as valid VNodes.

  ## Mitigations

  If you cannot upgrade immediately, implement the following mitigations:

  - **Validate input types:** Don't accept arbitrary objects as inputs in your API and blindly store them. Enforce strict type contracts at API boundaries.
  - **Cast or validate network data:** Don't assume strings are strings if your code got them from the network. Always cast to the expected type or validate before rendering.
  - **Sanitize external data:** Validate that data from external sources (APIs, storage, databases) matches expected types before passing it to preact.
  - **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to prevent inline script execution as a defense-in-depth measure.
