summary: |
  Invenio-Communities has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in React components
  # Impact

  We have identified a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within certain React components related to community members in the Invenio-Communities module. This vulnerability enables a user to inject a script tag into the Affiliations field during the account registration process. The malicious script is executed when the user creates a new community and is listed as a public member.

  The script is triggered whenever any user visits the Members section of any community that includes the compromised user. This can potentially allow the attacker to access personal information, such as cookies, of the visiting user.

  # Patches
  The problem has been patched in [v7.8.0](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-communities/releases/tag/v7.8.0). Patches also have been backported in versions [v4.2.2](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-communities/tree/v4.2.2) and [v2.8.11](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-communities/tree/v2.8.11).
