  - CVE-2025-68371
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: smartpqi:
  Fix device resources accessed after device removal  Correct possible race conditions during
  device removal.  Previously, a scheduled work item to reset a LUN could still execute after
  the device was removed, leading to use-after-free and other resource access issues.  This
  race condition occurs because the abort handler may schedule a LUN reset concurrently with
  device removal via sdev_destroy(), leading to use-after-free and improper access to freed
  resources.    - Check in the device reset handler if the device is still present in     the
  controller''s SCSI device list before running; if not, the reset     is skipped.    - Cancel
  any pending TMF work that has not started in sdev_destroy().    - Ensure device freeing in
  sdev_destroy() is done while holding the     LUN reset mutex to avoid races with ongoing resets.'
