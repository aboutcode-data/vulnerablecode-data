  Execution with Unnecessary Privileges in arc-electron
  When the end-user click on the response header that contains a link the target will be opened in ARC new window. This window will have the default preload script loaded which allows the scripts embedded in the link target to execute any logic that ARC has access to from the renderer process, which includes file system access, data store access (which may contain sensitive information), and some additional processes that only ARC should have access to.
