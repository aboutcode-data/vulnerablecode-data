  step-ca Has Improper Authorization Check for SSH Certificate Revocation
  ## Summary
  An authorized attacker can bypass authorization checks and revoke any SSH certificate issued by Step CA by using a valid revocation token.

  ## Details
  Step CA users can obtain SSH certificates from a few provisioners. The SSHPOP provisioner allows revocation of the SSH certificate (preventing future certificate renewals) using a token. Due to a missing validity check, this token could be used to revoke any SSH certificate issued by the CA.

  To create a token, an attacker must have access to the CA endpoint and a valid SSH certificate, meaning they were already authorized to obtain an SSH certificate. The attacker must also know the serial number of the certificate they want to revoke.

  ## Impact
  There is no way to mitigate this attack. It is recommended to update to v0.29.0 or newer.

  ## Fix
  In v0.29.0, the token validation logic was strengthened to bind each token to a specific SSH certificate serial number.
