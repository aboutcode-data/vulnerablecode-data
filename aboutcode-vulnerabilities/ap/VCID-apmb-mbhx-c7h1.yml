summary: "Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java has a Key Commitment Issue\n## Summary\n\nS3\
  \ Encryption Client for Java is an open-source client-side encryption library used to facilitate\
  \ writing and reading encrypted records to S3.  \n\nWhen the encrypted data key (EDK) is stored\
  \ in an \"Instruction File\" instead of S3's metadata record, the EDK is exposed to an \"\
  Invisible Salamanders\" attack  (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016), which could allow the\
  \ EDK to be replaced with a new key. \n\n\n## Impact\n\n### Background - Key Commitment\n\n\
  There is a cryptographic property whereby under certain conditions, a single ciphertext could\
  \ be decrypted into 2 different plaintexts by using different encryption keys. To address\
  \ this issue, strong encryption schemes use what is known as \"key commitment\", a process\
  \ by which an encrypted message can only be decrypted by one key; the key used to originally\
  \ encrypt the message. \n\nIn older versions of S3EC, when customers are also using a feature\
  \ called \"Instruction File\" to store EDKs, key commitment is not implemented because multiple\
  \ EDKs could be associated to an underlying encrypted message object. For such customers an\
  \ attack that leverages the lack of key commitment is possible. A bad actor would need two\
  \ things to leverage this issue: (i) the ability to create a separate, rogue, EDK that will\
  \ also decrypt the underlying object to produce desired plaintext, and (ii) permission to\
  \ upload a new instruction file to the S3 bucket to replace the existing instruction file\
  \ placed there by the user using the S3C.  Any future attempt to decrypt the underlying encrypted\
  \ message with the S3EC will unwittingly use the rogue EDK to produce a valid plaintext message.\n\
  \nImpacted versions: <= v3.5\n\n## Patches\n\nS3 Encryption Client is introducing the concept\
  \ of \"key commitment\" to S3EC where the EDK is cryptographically bound to the ciphertext\
  \ in order to address this issue. In order to maintain compatibility for in-flight messages\
  \ we are releasing the fix in two versions.  A code-compatible minor version that can read\
  \ messages with key-commitment but not write them, and a new major version that can both read\
  \ and write messages with key-commitment. For maximum safety customers are asked to upgrade\
  \ to the latest major version: 4.0.0 or later\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds,\
  \ please upgrade to the suggested version of S3EC.\n\n## References\n\nIf users have any questions\
  \ or comments about this advisory, S3 Encryption Client asks that they contact AWS Security\
  \ via our issue reporting page or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\
  \ Please do not create a public GitHub issue."
