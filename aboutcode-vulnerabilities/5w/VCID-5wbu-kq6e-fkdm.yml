summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ipa: only
  reset hashed tables when supported  Last year, the code that manages GSI channel transactions
  switched from using spinlock-protected linked lists to using indexes into the ring buffer
  used for a channel.  Recently, Google reported seeing transaction reference count underflows
  occasionally during shutdown.  Doug Anderson found a way to reproduce the issue reliably,
  and bisected the issue to the commit that eliminated the linked lists and the lock.  The root
  cause was ultimately determined to be related to unused transactions being committed as part
  of the modem shutdown cleanup activity.  Unused transactions are not normally expected (except
  in error cases).  The modem uses some ranges of IPA-resident memory, and whenever it shuts
  down we zero those ranges.  In ipa_filter_reset_table() a transaction is allocated to zero
  modem filter table entries.  If hashing is not supported, hashed table memory should not be
  zeroed. But currently nothing prevents that, and the result is an unused transaction.  Something
  similar occurs when we zero routing table entries for the modem.  By preventing any attempt
  to clear hashed tables when hashing is not supported, the reference count underflow is avoided
  in this case.  Note that there likely remains an issue with properly freeing unused transactions
  (if they occur due to errors).  This patch addresses only the underflows that Google originally
  reported.'
