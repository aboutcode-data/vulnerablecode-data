summary: |
  Directory Traversal in featurebook
  Affected versions of `featurebook` resolve relative file paths, resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.

  The `featurebook` package is not intended to be run in production code nor to be exposed to an untrusted network.


  ## Proof of Concept
  ```
  GET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
  host:foo
  ```


  ## Recommendation

  No direct patch is currently available.

  At this time, the best mitigation is to ensure that `featurebook` is not running in production or exposed to an untrusted network.
