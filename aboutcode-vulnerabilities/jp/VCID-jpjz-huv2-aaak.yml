summary: |
  ferris-says has undefined behavior when not using UTF-8
  Affected versions receive a `&[u8]` from the caller through a safe API, and pass it directly to the unsafe `str::from_utf8_unchecked` function.

  The behavior of `ferris_says::say` is undefined if the bytes from the caller don't happen to be valid UTF-8.

  The flaw was corrected in [ferris-says#21] by using the safe `str::from_utf8` instead, and returning an error on invalid input. However this fix has not yet been published to crates.io as a patch version for 0.2.

  Separately, [ferris-says#32] has introduced a different API for version 0.3 which accepts input as `&str` rather than `&[u8]`, so is unaffected by this bug.
