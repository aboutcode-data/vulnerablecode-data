summary: "October CMS Vulnerable to Stored XSS via Branding Styles\nA cross-site scripting (XSS)\
  \ vulnerabilities was identified in October CMS backend configuration forms:\n\n- **Branding\
  \ and Appearances Styles**  \n   A user with the `Customize Backend Styles` permission could\
  \ inject malicious HTML/JS into the stylesheet input at  \n   *Settings → Branding & Appearance\
  \ → Styles*.  \n\nA specially crafted input could break out of the intended `<style>` context,\
  \ allowing arbitrary script execution across backend pages for all users.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\
  - Persistent XSS across the backend interface.  \n- Exploitable by lower-privileged accounts\
  \ with the above permissions.  \n- Potential consequences include privilege escalation, session\
  \ hijacking, and execution of unauthorized actions in victim sessions.\n\n---\n\n### Patches\n\
  The vulnerability has been patched in **v4.0.12** and **v3.7.13**.  \nStylesheet inputs are\
  \ now sanitized to prevent injection of arbitrary HTML/JS.  \n\nAll users are strongly encouraged\
  \ to upgrade to the latest patched version.\n\n---\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading immediately\
  \ is not possible:  \n- Restrict the permissions `Customize Backend Styles` to fully trusted\
  \ administrators only.  \n\nThis reduces exposure but does not fully eliminate risk.\n\n---\n\
