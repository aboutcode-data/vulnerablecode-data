summary: "## ASA-2024-003: Missing `BlockedAddressed` Validation in Vesting Module\n\n**Component**:\
  \ Cosmos SDK\n**Criticality**: Low\n**Affected Versions**: Cosmos SDK versions <= 0.50.3;\
  \ <= 0.47.8\n**Affected Users**: Chain developers, Validator and Node operators\n**Impact**:\
  \ Denial of Service\n\n## Description\n\nA vulnerability was identified in the `x/auth/vesting`\
  \ module, which can allow a user to create a periodic vesting account on a blocked address,\
  \ for example a non-initialized module account. Additional validation was added to prevent\
  \ creation of a periodic vesting account in this scenario.\n\nIf this case is triggered, there\
  \ is the potential for a chain halt if the uninitialized account in question is called by\
  \ `GetModuleAccount` in `Begin`/`EndBlock` of a module. This combination of an uninitialized\
  \ blocked module account is not common.  \n\n## Next Steps for Impacted Parties\n\nIf your\
  \ chain has uninitialized blocked module accounts, it is recommended to proactively initialize\
  \ them, as they are often initialized during a chain migration or during init genesis.\n\n\
  If you are a chain developer on an affected version of the Cosmos SDK, it is advised to update\
  \ to the latest available version of the Cosmos SDK for your project.  Once a patched version\
  \ is available, it is recommended that network operators upgrade.\n\nA Github Security Advisory\
  \ for this issue is available in the Cosmos-SDK [repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories).\
  \ For more information about Cosmos SDK, see https://docs.cosmos.network/.\n\nThis issue was\
  \ found by [Dongsam](https://github.com/dongsam) who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty\
  \ Program on HackerOne on January 30, 2024. If you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain\
  \ Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting a bug, please see https://hackerone.com/cosmos.\n\
  \n## Addendum\n\nA variant trigger of this issue via the `x/authz` and `x/feegrant` modules\
  \ was discovered by [Richie](https://github.com/sushiwushi) who reported it to the Cosmos\
  \ Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on April 6th, 2024, and was subsequently fixed by the Cosmos\
  \ SDK team on April 21st, 2024.  The guidance for mitigating this additional variant is the\
  \ same as the parent advisory, so it is suggested that all chains proactively initialize module\
  \ accounts if they have not already done so."
