  cheqd-node affected by Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement
  # Description

  [An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6f-48ff-5xrw) that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain.

  This an upstream dependency used in cheqd-node, rather than a custom module.

  ## Impact
  Could result in a chain halt.

  ## Patches
  Validators, full nodes, and IBC relayers should upgrade to **[cheqd-node v3.1.7](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v3.1.7)**. This upgrade does not require a software upgrade proposal on-chain and is meant to be non state-breaking.
