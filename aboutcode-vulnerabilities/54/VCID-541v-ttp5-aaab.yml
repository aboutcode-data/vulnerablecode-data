summary: |
  Remote code execution via handlebars helper
  The gem contains a flaw in helper method dispatch where it uses Kernel::send to call helpers without checking that they are defined within the template context first. This allows expressions such as {{system "ls"}} or {{eval "puts 1 + 1"}} to be executed.
