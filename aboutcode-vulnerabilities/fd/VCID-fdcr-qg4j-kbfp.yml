summary: "uv has differential in tar extraction with PAX headers\n### Impact\n\nIn versions\
  \ 0.9.4 and earlier of uv, tar archives containing PAX headers with file size overrides were\
  \ not handled properly. As a result, an attacker could contrive a source distribution (as\
  \ a tar archive) that would extract differently when installed via uv versus other Python\
  \ package installers.\n\nThe underlying parsing differential here originates with astral-tokio-tar,\
  \ which disclosed this vulnerability as CVE-2025-62518.\n\nIn practice, the impact of this\
  \ vulnerability is **low**: only source distributions can be formatted as tar archives, and\
  \ source distributions execute arbitrary code at build/installation time by definition. Consequently,\
  \ a parser differential in tar extraction is strictly less powerful than the capabilities\
  \ already exposed to an attacker who has the ability to control source distributions. \n\n\
  However, this particular source of malleability in source distributions is unintentional and\
  \ not operating by design, and therefore we consider it a vulnerability despite its overlap\
  \ in capabilities with intended behavior.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersions 0.9.5 and newer of uv\
  \ address the vulnerability above. Users should upgrade to 0.9.5 or newer.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nUsers are advised to upgrade to version 0.9.5 or newer to address this advisory.\n\nUsers\
  \ should experience no breaking changes as a result of the patch above.\n\n### References\n\
