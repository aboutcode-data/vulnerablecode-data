summary: "IBC-Go: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in\
  \ a chain halt\nName: ISA-2025-001: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement\
  \ can result in a chain halt\nComponent: IBC-Go\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely\
  \ Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\n\
  Affected versions: IBC-Go >= v7; Earlier IBC-Go versions MAY also be affected.\nAffected users:\
  \ Validators, Full nodes, IBC Middleware authors\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue was discovered\
  \ in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior\
  \ which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to\
  \ the chain. The following patch is in addition to the previous patch which now extends the\
  \ same protection to all applications beyond transfer.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new IBC-Go releases\
  \ below address this issue:\n\n* [v7.10.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0)\n\
  * [v8.7.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo\
  \ prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel\
  \ Opening as a workaround.\n\n### Notes on Re-Release\n\nThis is an extension of the previous\
  \ patch, please update to the latest patch to get full coverage against the reported issue.\n\
  \n#### Is this state breaking?\n\nThis patch is not state breaking unless an exploit is submitted\
  \ before the patch is applied across the network in which case the chain will halt just as\
  \ if it was unpatched. Thus, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner and encourage\
  \ validators to patch as soon as possible in order to prevent any chain halts (and we've already\
  \ cut new versions of these for you).\n\n#### Testing we have done to gain more confidence\
  \ in this release\n* In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:\n* Tested PFM\
  \ v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n\
  * Ran a patched node on Cosmos Hub Mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions\
  \ that used PFM\n* Ran a patched node on Osmosis mainnet and triggered failing and successful\
  \ transactions that used ibc-hooks\nThis is a more thorough process than before, so we have\
  \ higher confidence.\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by swelf19\
  \ on HackerOne on February 18, 2025. If you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain\
  \ Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting a bug, please see https://hackerone.com/cosmos.\n\
