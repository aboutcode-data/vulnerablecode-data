summary: |
  Crayfish allows Remote Code Execution via Homarus Authorization header
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus.

  Configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.
