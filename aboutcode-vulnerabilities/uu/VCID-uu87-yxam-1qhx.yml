  Reflected XSS in go-httpbin due to unrestricted client control over Content-Type
  ### Description

  The go-httpbin framework is vulnerable to XSS as the user can control the `Response Content-Type` from GET parameter. This allows attacker to execute cross site scripts in victims browser.

  ### Affected URLs:
  - `/response-headers?Content-Type=text/html&xss=%3Cimg/src/onerror=alert(%27xss%27)%3E`
  - `/base64/PGltZy9zcmMvb25lcnJvcj1hbGVydCgneHNzJyk+?content-type=text/html`
  - `/base64/decode/PGltZy9zcmMvb25lcnJvcj1hbGVydCgneHNzJyk+?content-type=text/html`

  ### Steps to reproduce:
  1. Visit one of the above mentioned URLs.
  2. XSS window will popup

  ### Suggested fix
  - Allow Only Safe Content-Type Values Or give users option to define whitelisted Content-Type headers


  ### Criticality
  The following can be major impacts of the issue:
  * Access to victim's sensitive Personal Identifiable Information.
  * Access to CSRF token
  * Cookie injection
  * Phishing
  * And any other thing Javascript can perform
