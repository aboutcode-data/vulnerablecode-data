  SpiceDB: LookupResources with Multiple Entrypoints across Different Definitions Can Return Incomplete Results
  ### Impact

  If a schema includes the following characteristics:

  1. Permission defined in terms of a union (`+`)
  1. That union references the same relation on both sides, but one side arrows to a different permission

  Then you might have missing `LookupResources` results when checking the permission. This only affects `LookupResources`; other APIs calculate permissionship correctly.

  A small concrete example:

  ```
  relation doer_of_things: user | group#member
  permission do_the_thing = doer_of_things + doer_of_things->admin
  ```

  A CheckPermission on `do_the_thing` will return the correct permissionship, but a LookupResources on `do_the_thing` may miss resources.

  #### A Comprehensive Example

  If you have a schema with a structure like this:

  ```
  definition special_user {}

  definition user {
    relation special_user_mapping: special_user
    permission special_user = special_user_mapping
  }
  definition group {
     relation member: user
     permission membership = member + member->special_user
  }

  definition system {
    relation viewer: user | group#membership
    // This is the problematic permission
    permission view = viewer + viewer->special_user
  }
  ```

  And these relationships:
  ```
  system:somesystem#viewer@group:somegroup#membership
  group:somegroup#member@user:someuser1
  user:someuser1#special_user_mapping@special_user:specialuser
  ```

  And you call LookupResources with:
  ```
  subject_type: user
  subject_id: someuser1
  permission: view
  resource_type: system
  ```

  You would expect to receive `system:somesystem` in the results, but you do not.

  Note that this only applies to `LookupResources`; if you `CheckPermission` for that resource specifically, it will return `HasPermission`.

  ### Patches

  The issue is fixed in v1.47.1. Upgrading to this version will remediate this issue.
