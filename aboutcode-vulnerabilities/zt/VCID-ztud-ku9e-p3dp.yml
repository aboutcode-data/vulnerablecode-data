  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vhost-scsi: Fix handling of multiple calls to vhost_scsi_set_endpoint

  If vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times without a
  vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs
  found by Haoran Zhang:

  1. Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:

  This fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is
  called more than once and calls after the first call do not find any
  tpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds
  tpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:

  vhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);
  ...

  kfree(vs->vs_tpg);
  vs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;

  If vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found
  match=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the
  pointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:

  kfree(vs->vs_tpg);
  vs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;

  If a scsi request is then sent we do:

  vhost_scsi_handle_vq -> vhost_scsi_get_req -> vhost_vq_get_backend

  which sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.

  2. Tpg dir removal hang:

  This patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer
  tpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount
  dropping to -1.

  The problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already
  in the vs->vs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so
  target_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do
  target_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their
  refcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added
  in the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in
  previous calls which are also in vs->vs_tpg.

  Later, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do
  target_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs->vs_tpg which will drop
  their refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg
  and will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.

  3. Tpg leak:

  This fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be
  un-removable because the target name is overwritten when
  vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different
  target names.

  The bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup
  a vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls
  VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we
  haven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this
  happens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite
  the target name and the vs->vs_tpg array. Later when we do
  vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's
  name and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the
  vs->vs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing
  target_undepend_item on the tpgs.

  Because of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call
  vhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major
  user, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the
  issues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called
  if it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the
  tpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint
  first.
