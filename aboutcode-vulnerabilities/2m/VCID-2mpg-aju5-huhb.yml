  - CVE-2025-68375
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/x86: Fix
  NULL event access and potential PEBS record loss  When intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() is called
  to drain PEBS records, the perf_event_overflow() could be called to process the last PEBS
  record.  While perf_event_overflow() could trigger the interrupt throttle and stop all events
  of the group, like what the below call-chain shows.  perf_event_overflow()   -> __perf_event_overflow()     ->__perf_event_account_interrupt()       ->
  perf_event_throttle_group()         -> perf_event_throttle()           -> event->pmu->stop()             ->
  x86_pmu_stop()  The side effect of stopping the events is that all corresponding event pointers
  in cpuc->events[] array are cleared to NULL.  Assume there are two PEBS events (event a and
  event b) in a group. When intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() calls perf_event_overflow() to process
  the last PEBS record of PEBS event a, interrupt throttle is triggered and all pointers of
  event a and event b are cleared to NULL. Then intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() tries to process
  the last PEBS record of event b and encounters NULL pointer access.  To avoid this issue,
  move cpuc->events[] clearing from x86_pmu_stop() to x86_pmu_del(). It''s safe since cpuc->active_mask
  or cpuc->pebs_enabled is always checked before access the event pointer from cpuc->events[].'
