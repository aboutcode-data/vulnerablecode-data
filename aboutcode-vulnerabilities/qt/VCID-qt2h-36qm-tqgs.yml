  - CVE-2023-54062
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix invalid
  free tracking in ext4_xattr_move_to_block()  In ext4_xattr_move_to_block(), the value of the
  extended attribute which we need to move to an external block may be allocated by kvmalloc()
  if the value is stored in an external inode.  So at the end of the function the code tried
  to check if this was the case by testing entry->e_value_inum.  However, at this point, the
  pointer to the xattr entry is no longer valid, because it was removed from the original location
  where it had been stored.  So we could end up calling kvfree() on a pointer which was not
  allocated by kvmalloc(); or we could also potentially leak memory by not freeing the buffer
  when it should be freed.  Fix this by storing whether it should be freed in a separate variable.'
