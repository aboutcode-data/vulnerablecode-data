summary: "ckb: Large dep group requires a lot of resources to process but the cost to commit\
  \ the transaction is very low.\n### Impact\n\nWhen a transaction contains a dep group with\
  \ many cells, the resources required to process it are not linear to the transaction size\
  \ nor spent script cycles. \n\n### Patches\n\nIn 0.43.3, nodes drop the transactions relayed\
  \ to them when they contain a dep group with more than 64 cells. They do not ban peers who\
  \ send them such transactions.\n\nIn 0.100, the consensus disallow transactions using a dep\
  \ group with more than 64 cells. Peers relaying such transaction must be banned. Blocks committing\
  \ such transactions must be rejected."
