summary: "Babylon Finality Provider `MsgCommitPubRandList` replay attack\n### Summary\n\nA high\
  \ vulnerability exists in the Babylon protocol's x/finality module due to a lack of domain\
  \ separation in signed messages, combined with insufficient validation in the MsgCommitPubRandList\
  \ handler. Specifically, the handler does not enforce that the submitted Commitment field\
  \ is 32 bytes long. This allows an attacker to replay a signature originally generated for\
  \ a different message (e.g., a Proof-of-Possession in MsgCreateFinalityProvider) as a MsgCommitPubRandList.\
  \ By crafting the message parameters, an attacker can use the typically 20-byte address bytes\
  \ (from the PoP context) to form the StartHeight, NumPubRand, and a shorter-than-expected\
  \ Commitment (e.g., 4 bytes). The replayed signature will pass verification for this crafted\
  \ message, leading to the injection of an invalid PubRand commitment.\n\n### Impact\n\nSuccessful\
  \ exploitation of this vulnerability, specifically via the PoP signature replay, allows an\
  \ attacker to store an invalid PubRand commitment (with a non-standard length, e.g., 4 bytes)\
  \ for a targeted Finality Provider (FP). Despite the commitment itself being malformed, it's\
  \ the associated StartHeight and NumPubRand (derived from the replayed address bytes and typically\
  \ very large) that cause severe consequences\n\n### Future recommendations\n\nTo minimize\
  \ future risk of such attacks, all finality providers should:\n1.  Never re-use your finality\
  \ provider EOTS across the networks (e.g., the testnet) or for any other purpose. \n2. Never\
  \ use EOTS keys to sign any other data than relevant to in-protocol messages. Ideally EOTS\
  \ key should only be used to:\n    - Sign initial proof of possession message\n    - Sign\
  \ periodic randomness commits\n    - Sign finality votes with every block"
