summary: "Cosmos SDK: x/group can halt when erroring in EndBlocker\nName: ISA-2025-002: x/group\
  \ can halt when erroring in EndBlocker\nComponent: CosmosSDK\nCriticality: High (Considerable\
  \ Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\n\
  Affected versions: <= v0.47.16, <= 0.50.12\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, Users\
  \ on chains that utilize the groups module\nCosmos SDK chains in unpatched releases that use\
  \ the `x/group` module are affected.\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue was discovered in the\
  \ groups module where malicious proposals would result in an errors triggered in the module's\
  \ end blocker that could result in a chain halt.  Any set of users that can interact with\
  \ the groups module could introduce this state.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?\
  \ What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThe new Cosmos SDK release [v0.50.13](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.50.13)\
  \ and [v0.47.17](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.17) fix this issue.\n\
  \n### Testing\n\nTesting we have done to gain more confidence in this release:\n\nIn addition\
  \ to testing Cosmos SDK we also did the following:\n\n- Ran a patched node in a local `v0.50`\
  \ testnet with the failing state and did not halt (an unpatched network confirmed to halt)\n\
  - Ran a patched node on Xion Mainnet (uses `x/group`)\n- Ran a patched node on Zetachain Mainnet\
  \ (uses `x/xgroup`)\n    \n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate\
  \ the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue.\
  \ It is advised that chains apply the update.\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug\
  \ Bounty Program by [dongsam](https://github.com/dongsam) on HackerOne on February 28, 2025.\
