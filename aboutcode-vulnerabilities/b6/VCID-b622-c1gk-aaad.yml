  Insufficient Session Expiration in @cyyynthia/tokenize
  ### Impact
  A bug introduced made Tokenize generate faulty tokens with NaN as a generation date. As a result, tokens would not properly expire and remain valid regardless of the `lastTokenReset` field.

  ### Patches
   contains a patch that'll invalidate these faulty tokens and make new ones behave as expected.

  ### Workarounds
  None. Tokens do not hold the necessary information to perform invalidation anymore.
