summary: |
  Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization
  Affected versions of this crate did not properly check for recursion while deserializing aliases. This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with an alias referring to itself causing an abort. The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth.
