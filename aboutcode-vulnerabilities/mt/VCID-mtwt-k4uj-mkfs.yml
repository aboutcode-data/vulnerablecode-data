summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: core: Prevent
  invalid memory access when there is no parent  Commit 813665564b3d ("iio: core: Convert to
  use firmware node handle instead of OF node") switched the kind of nodes to use for label
  retrieval in device registration.  Probably an unwanted change in that commit was that if
  the device has no parent then NULL pointer is accessed.  This is what happens in the stock
  IIO dummy driver when a new entry is created in configfs:    # mkdir /sys/kernel/config/iio/devices/dummy/foo   BUG:
  kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: ...   ...   Call Trace:   __iio_device_register   iio_dummy_probe  Since
  there seems to be no reason to make a parent device of an IIO dummy device mandatory, let’s
  prevent the invalid memory access in __iio_device_register when the parent device is NULL.  With
  this change, the IIO dummy driver works fine with configfs.'
