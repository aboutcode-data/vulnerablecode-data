summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Protect
  against send buffer overflow in NFSv3 READDIR  Since before the git era, NFSD has conserved
  the number of pages held by each nfsd thread by combining the RPC receive and send buffers
  into a single array of pages. This works because there are no cases where an operation needs
  a large RPC Call message and a large RPC Reply message at the same time.  Once an RPC Call
  has been received, svc_process() updates svc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages
  that can be used for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer (rq_res) shrinks
  when the received RPC record containing the RPC Call is large.  A client can force this shrinkage
  on TCP by sending a correctly- formed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is excessively
  large. The full maximum payload size cannot be constructed in that case.  Thanks to Aleksi
  Illikainen and Kari Hulkko for uncovering this issue.'
