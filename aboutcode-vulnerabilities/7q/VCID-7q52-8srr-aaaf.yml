summary: "Candy Machine Set Collection During Mint Missing Check\nA problem with Candy Machine\
  \ V2 allow minting NFTs to an arbitrary collection due to a missing check.\n\nHere is a description\
  \ of the exploit:\nDetails:\nHere is the tx/ix to exploit:\nTransaction:\nIx 1: candy_machine\
  \ v2, mint_nft, passing in empty metadata -1\nIx 2: custom handler, 0\n\t\tcpi A --> token_metadata\
  \ create_metadata_account, creates NFT\n\t\tcpi B --> candy_machine v2, set_collection_during_mint\n\
  Ix 1 passes our first check for empty metadata, but eventually will hit a bot tax and return\
  \ Ok.  We do have a CPI check in this function but even if we hit that or moved it to the\
  \ top, it returns Ok as a bot tax and still enables the issue.\nIx 2, cpi A is Ok and mints\
  \ an arbitrary NFT.\nIx 2, cpi B checks the previous instruction using index_relative_to_current-1.\
  \  This turns out to be Ix 1 which was Ok, so then your newly minted arbitrary NFT is successfully\
  \ added to the collection.\nConclusion:\nCandy machine could be out of NFTs and it still works.\
  \  If the CM is closed, (we think?) it doesn't get to the check.\nThe fix needs to be in set_collection_during_mint\
  \ that current program ID id candy_machine_v2.  It checks previous program ID but doesn't\
  \ check current.\n\nNOTE: THIS DOES NOT AFFECT Cmv3"
