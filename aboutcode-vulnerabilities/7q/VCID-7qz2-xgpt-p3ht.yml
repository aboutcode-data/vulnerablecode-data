  - CVE-2022-50720
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/apic: Don''t
  disable x2APIC if locked  The APIC supports two modes, legacy APIC (or xAPIC), and Extended
  APIC (or x2APIC).  X2APIC mode is mostly compatible with legacy APIC, but it disables the
  memory-mapped APIC interface in favor of one that uses MSRs.  The APIC mode is controlled
  by the EXT bit in the APIC MSR.  The MMIO/xAPIC interface has some problems, most notably
  the APIC LEAK [1].  This bug allows an attacker to use the APIC MMIO interface to extract
  data from the SGX enclave.  Introduce support for a new feature that will allow the BIOS to
  lock the APIC in x2APIC mode.  If the APIC is locked in x2APIC mode and the kernel tries to
  disable the APIC or revert to legacy APIC mode a GP fault will occur.  Introduce support for
  a new MSR (IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS) and handle the new locked mode when the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED
  bit is set by preventing the kernel from trying to disable the x2APIC.  On platforms with
  the IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS MSR, if SGX or TDX are enabled the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED will
  be set by the BIOS.  If legacy APIC is required, then it SGX and TDX need to be disabled in
  the BIOS.  [1]: https://aepicleak.com/aepicleak.pdf'
