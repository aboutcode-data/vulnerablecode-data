  Cosmos SDK's Integer Overflow vulnerability in its Validator Rewards pool can cause a chain halt
  Description
  Name: ISA-2025-005: Integer Overflow in Cosmos SDK
  Component: CosmosSDK
  Criticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))
  Affected versions: <= v0.50.13, <= 0.53.2
  Affected users: Validators, Full nodes, Users on chains that utilize the distribution module
  Cosmos SDK chains in unpatched releases that use the x/distribution module are affected.

  Description
  An issue was discovered in the distribution module where a malicious deposit into the Validator Rewards pool would result in an integer overflow that would cause a chain halt. A malicious validator can interact with the distribution module to introduce this state.

  Patches
  Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?

  The new Cosmos SDK release [v0.50.14](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.50.14) and [v0.53.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.53.3) fix this issue.

  There are no known workarounds for this issue. It is advised that chains apply the update.
