  Denial of Service in apostrophe
  Versions of `apostrophe` prior to 2.97.1 are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The `apostrophe-jobs` module sets a callback for incoming jobs and doesn't clear it regardless of its status. This causes the server to accumulate callbacks, allowing an attacker to start a large number of jobs and exhaust system memory.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.97.1 or later.
