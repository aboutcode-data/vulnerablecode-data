  Regular Expression Denial of Service in markdown
  All versions of `markdown` are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The `markdown.toHTML()` function has significantly degraded performance when parsing long strings containing underscores. This may lead to Denial of Service if the parser accepts user input. No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
