summary: |
  Directory Traversal in ltt.js
  Affected versions of `ltt.js` resolve relative file paths, resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.

  Example request:
  ```
  GET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
  host:foo
  ``` No patch is available for this vulnerability.

  It is recommended that the package is only used for local development, and if the functionality is needed for production, a different package is used instead.
