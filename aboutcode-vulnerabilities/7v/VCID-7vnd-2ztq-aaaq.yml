summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting with connect.methodOverride()
  The middleware overwrites req.method with the req.body['_method'] value. When you don't catch the error it responds with a default error msg: "Cannot [METHOD] [URL]" . Because this is not enough sanitized, you can force a Cross-Site Scripting in the response.
