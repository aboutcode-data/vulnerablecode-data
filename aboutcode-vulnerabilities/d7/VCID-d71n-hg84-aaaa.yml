summary: |
  Constallation has pods exposed to peers in VPC
  ### Impact

  Cilium allows outside actors (`world` entity) to directly access pods with their internal pod IP, even if they are not exposed explicitly (e.g. via `LoadBalancer`). A pod that does not authenticate clients and that does not exclude `world` traffic via network policy may leak sensitive data to an attacker _inside the cloud VPC_.

  ### Patches

  The issue has been patched in [v2.16.3](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/releases/tag/v2.16.3).

  ### Workarounds

  This network policy excludes all `world` traffic. It mitigates the problem, but will also block all desired external traffic. If vulnerable pods are known, a policy can be crafted to only firewall those instead (see also https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#access-to-from-outside-cluster).

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
  kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: "from-world-to-role-public"
  spec:
    endpointSelector:
      matchLabels: {}
      #  role: public
    ingressDeny:
      - fromEntities:
        - world
  ```
