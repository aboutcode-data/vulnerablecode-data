summary: |
  A failed upgrade may lead to hung goroutines
  ### Impact
  Processes using tableflip may encounter hung goroutines in the parent process, after a failed upgrade.

  The Go runtime has annoying behaviour around setting and clearing
  O_NONBLOCK: exec.Cmd.Start() ends up calling os.File.Fd() for any
  file in exec.Cmd.ExtraFiles. os.File.Fd() disables both the use
  of the runtime poller for the file and clears O_NONBLOCK from
  the underlying open file descriptor.

  This can lead to goroutines hanging in a parent process, after at least
  one failed upgrade. The bug manifests in goroutines which rely on
  either a deadline or interruption via Close() to be unblocked being stuck
  in read or accept like syscalls. As far as I can tell we've not experienced
  this problem in production, so it's most likely quite rare.

  ### Patches
  The problem has been fixed in v1.2.2.

  ### Workarounds
  None.
