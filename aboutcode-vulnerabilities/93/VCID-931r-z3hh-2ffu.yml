summary: |
  Babylon's malformed vote extensions are not rejected
  ### Summary

  Adversarial validators can send large vote extensions by using non-existing protobuf tags. This will result in the rejection of the subsequent block proposal. Eventually, all block proposals will be rejected by all validators.

  ### Impact

  A small group of adversarial validators can cause a chain halt.
