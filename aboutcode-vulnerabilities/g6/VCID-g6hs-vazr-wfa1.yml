summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: move init
  of percpu reply_cache_stats counters back to nfsd_init_net  Commit f5f9d4a314da ("nfsd: move
  reply cache initialization into nfsd startup") moved the initialization of the reply cache
  into nfsd startup, but didn''t account for the stats counters, which can be accessed before
  nfsd is ever started. The result can be a NULL pointer dereference when someone accesses /proc/fs/nfsd/reply_cache_stats
  while nfsd is still shut down.  This is a regression and a user-triggerable oops in the right
  situation:  - non-x86_64 arch - /proc/fs/nfsd is mounted in the namespace - nfsd is not started
  in the namespace - unprivileged user calls "cat /proc/fs/nfsd/reply_cache_stats"  Although
  this is easy to trigger on some arches (like aarch64), on x86_64, calling this_cpu_ptr(NULL)
  evidently returns a pointer to the fixed_percpu_data. That struct looks just enough like a
  newly initialized percpu var to allow nfsd_reply_cache_stats_show to access it without Oopsing.  Move
  the initialization of the per-net+per-cpu reply-cache counters back into nfsd_init_net, while
  leaving the rest of the reply cache allocations to be done at nfsd startup time.  Kudos to
  Eirik who did most of the legwork to track this down.'
