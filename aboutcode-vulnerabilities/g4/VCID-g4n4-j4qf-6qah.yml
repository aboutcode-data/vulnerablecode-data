aliases:
  - CVE-2023-54096
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soundwire: fix
  enumeration completion  The soundwire subsystem uses two completion structures that allow
  drivers to wait for soundwire device to become enumerated on the bus and initialised by their
  drivers, respectively.  The code implementing the signalling is currently broken as it does
  not signal all current and future waiters and also uses the wrong reinitialisation function,
  which can potentially lead to memory corruption if there are still waiters on the queue.  Not
  signalling future waiters specifically breaks sound card probe deferrals as codec drivers
  can not tell that the soundwire device is already attached when being reprobed. Some codec
  runtime PM implementations suffer from similar problems as waiting for enumeration during
  resume can also timeout despite the device already having been enumerated.'
