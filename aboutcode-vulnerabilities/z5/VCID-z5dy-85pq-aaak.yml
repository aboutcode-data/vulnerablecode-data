  SecureJoin: on windows, paths outside of the rootfs could be inadvertently produced
  ### Impact
  For Windows users of `github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin`, until v0.2.4 it was possible for certain rootfs and path combinations (in particular, where a malicious Unix-style `/`-separated unsafe path was used with a Windows-style rootfs path) to result in generated paths that were outside of the provided rootfs.

  It is unclear to what extent this has a practical impact on real users, but given the possible severity of the issue we have released an emergency patch release that resolves this issue.

  Thanks to  @pjbgf for discovering, debugging, and fixing this issue (as well as writing some tests for it).

  ### Patches
  c121231e1276e11049547bee5ce68d5a2cfe2d9b is the patch fixing this issue. v0.2.4 contains the fix.

  ### Workarounds
  Users could use `filepath.FromSlash()` on all unsafe paths before passing them to `filepath-securejoin`.

  See #9.
