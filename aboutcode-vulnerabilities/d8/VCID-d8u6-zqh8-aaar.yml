  Remote code execution
  An integer overflow can occur when processing any variant of a "literal run". When certain payloads are processed, a pointer to an output buffer can be set to an address outside the output buffer. Since the attacker can specify exact offsets in memory, it is very easy to create a reliable Remote Code Execution exploit.
