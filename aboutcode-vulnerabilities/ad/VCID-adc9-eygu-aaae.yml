  Arbitrary File Write in bin-links
  Versions of `bin-links` are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. The package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended `node_modules` folder through the `bin` field. This allows attackers to create arbitrary files in the system. Note it is not possible to overwrite files that already exist. ## Recommendation
