  \ Compose 1.8+\n### Impact\n\nUnder specific circumstances, text composables may contain unmasked\
  \ sensitive data in Android session replays.  You may be impacted if you meet the following\
  \ conditions:\n- Using any `sentry-android` with versions < 8.14.0 \n- Using Jetpack Compose\
  \ >= [1.8.0-alpha08](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-ui#1.8.0-alpha08)\n\
  \  - This includes any alpha, beta, release candidate, or general availability after this\
  \ version\n- Have configured Sentry Session Replays for Android\n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> If you\
  \ do not use Jetpack Compose or have never used a version >= 1.8.0-alpha08 you are not impacted.\
  \ \n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> If you have not configured [Session Replays for Mobile](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/session-replay/mobile/)\
  \ you are not impacted.\n\n### How do I check if I'm impacted?\n\nIf you meet the conditions\
  \ above, the `sentry-android` package includes a [specific error log](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/blob/b2920907e6afb69a8027cedb251dd94a3514f0e6/sentry-android-replay/src/main/java/io/sentry/android/replay/viewhierarchy/ComposeViewHierarchyNode.kt#L252-L261)\
  \ that would indicate you may be impacted. Customers may use [logcat](https://developer.android.com/tools/logcat)\
  \ to search for this event.\n\n### I'm impacted and want this data deleted\n\nIf you've confirmed\
  \ that you're affected and unmasked sensitive data in Session Replays have reached Sentry\
  \ servers, you can please see this documentation on [deleting individual replays](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/session-replay/web/replay-details/#delete-replays).\
  \ If you'd like to request bulk deletion, please reach out to your Account Manager or support@sentry.io\
  \ to request deletion. \n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade the `sentry-android` SDK to version [8.14.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/tag/8.14.0)\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of the SDK, but if it is\
  \ not an option, customers may either:\n- Downgrade their use of Jetpack Compose to <= 1.7.x\n\
  - Drop session sample rates to 0.0 \n```\noptions.sessionReplay.onErrorSampleRate = 0.0\n\
  options.sessionReplay.sessionSampleRate = 0.0\n```\nPlease see our documentation for more\
  \ information configuring [Session Replays for Android](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/session-replay/#set-up).\n\
