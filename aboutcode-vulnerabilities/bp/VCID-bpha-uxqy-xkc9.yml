summary: |
  Flowise doesn't Prevent Bypass of Password Confirmation through Unverified Email Change (credentials)
  Unverified Email Change - Email as part of Credential / Unverified Account Recovery Channel Change

  The application allows changing the account email address (used as a login identifier and/or password recovery address) without verifying the requester’s authority to make that change (no confirmation to the old email, no authentication step). Because email often functions as a credential or recovery channel, unverified email changes enable attackers to take over accounts by switching the account’s recovery/login address.
