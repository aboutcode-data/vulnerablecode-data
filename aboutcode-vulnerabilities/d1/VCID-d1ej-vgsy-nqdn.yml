  - CVE-2025-68697
  - GHSA-j4p8-h8mh-rh8q
summary: |
  Self-hosted n8n has Legacy Code node that enables arbitrary file read/write
  ### Impact

  In self-hosted n8n instances where the Code node runs in legacy (non-task-runner) JavaScript execution mode, authenticated users with workflow editing access can invoke internal helper functions from within the Code node.

  This allows a workflow editor to perform actions on the n8n host with the same privileges as the n8n process, including:

  - Reading files from the host filesystem (subject to any file-access restrictions configured on the instance and OS/container permissions)
  - Writing files to the host filesystem (subject to the same restrictions)

  Starting with n8n version 1.2.1, access to files in the n8n home directory (`.n8n`) is blocked by default. However, this does not restrict access to other parts of the filesystem unless additional file access limitations are configured.

  ### Patches

  - Upgrade to **n8n version 2.0.0 or later**, where task runners are enabled by default for Code node execution.
  - On **n8n version 1.71.0 and above**, enable task runners by setting `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`.

  ### Workarounds

  If you cannot immediately migrate to task runners:

  - Limit file operations by setting `N8N_RESTRICT_FILE_ACCESS_TO` to a dedicated directory (e.g., `~/.n8n-files`) and ensure it contains no sensitive data.
  - Keep `N8N_BLOCK_FILE_ACCESS_TO_N8N_FILES=true` (default) to block access to `.n8n` and user-defined config files.
  - If workflow editors are not fully trusted, consider disabling high-risk nodes (including the Code node) using `NODES_EXCLUDE`.
