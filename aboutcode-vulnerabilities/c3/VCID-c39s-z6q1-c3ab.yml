  - GHSA-m9mp-6x32-5rhg
summary: |
  scio is vunerable to  Remote Command Execution  through PyTorch
  ### Impact
  PyTorch reported a [**critical** vulnerability](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/advisories/GHSA-53q9-r3pm-6pq6) when using `torch.load`, even with option `weights_only=True`, for `torch <= 2.5.1`.

  In `scio <= 1.0.0`, the lower bound for `torch` is `2.3`.

  ### Patches
  The lower bound was changed to `torch >= 2.6`, starting from `scio >= 1.0.1` (currently in dev state).

  ### Workarounds
  You can manually check that you are using `torch >= 2.6`.
