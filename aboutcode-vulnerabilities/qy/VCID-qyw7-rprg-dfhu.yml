summary: |
  users may append `root` to group listings
  Affected versions append `root` to group listings, unless the correct listing has exactly 1024 groups.

  This affects both:

  - The supplementary groups of a user
  - The group access list of the current process

  If the caller uses this information for access control, this may lead to privilege escalation.

  This crate is not currently maintained, so a patched version is not available.

  Versions older than 0.8.0 do not contain the affected functions, so downgrading to them is a workaround.

  ## Recommended alternatives
  - [`uzers`](https://crates.io/crates/uzers) (an actively maintained fork of the `users` crate)
  - [`sysinfo`](https://crates.io/crates/sysinfo)
