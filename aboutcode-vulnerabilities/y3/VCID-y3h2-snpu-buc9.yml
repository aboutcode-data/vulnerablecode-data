  - CVE-2025-62161
  - GHSA-4g74-7cff-xcv8
summary: |
  youki container escape via "masked path" abuse due to mount race conditions
  ### Impact ###

  youki utilizes bind mounting the container's `/dev/null` as a file mask. When performing this operation, the initial validation of the source `/dev/null` was insufficient. Specifically, we initially failed to verify whether `/dev/null` was genuinely present. However, we did perform validation to ensure that the `/dev/null` path existed within the container, including checking for symbolic links. Additionally, there was a vulnerability in the timing between validation and the actual mount operation.

  As a result, by replacing `/dev/null` with a symbolic link, we can bind-mount arbitrary files from the host system.

  This is a different project, but the core logic is similar to the CVE in runc. Issues were identified in runc, and verification was also conducted in youki to confirm the problems.

  ### Credits

  Thanks to Lei Wang (@ssst0n3 from Huawei) for finding and reporting the original runc's vulnerability (Attack 1), and Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) for discovering another attack vector in runc (Attack 2) based on @ssst0n3's initial findings.

  Also, @cyphar helped youki in finding the problem.
