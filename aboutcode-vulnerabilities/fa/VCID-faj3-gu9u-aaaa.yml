summary: "Prototype Pollution in deep-setter\nAll versions of `deep-setter` are vulnerable to\
  \ prototype pollution. The package does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype,\
  \ which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all\
  \ objects. \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative\
  \ package until a fix is made available."
